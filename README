Installation
------------
Just clone somewhere and then run setup.sh

Requirements
------------
You'll need Bitstream Vera Sans Mono, available from 
http://www.dafont.com/bitstream-vera-mono.font

You'll need to install Ack for :Ack support:
  Ubuntu:
    sudo apt-get install ack-grep
  OSX:
    brew install ack

If you want Terminal to use Monaco correctly, then:
fontforge -script vim/fontpatcher/fontpatcher /System/Library/Fonts/Monaco.dfont
